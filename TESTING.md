# Testing Strategy — Algorithm Metrics

The library's test strategy: every algorithm is validated against the **mathematical invariants of
its family**, not golden output. This is the reference for the `unit-tester` agent (and humans) when
writing **unit tests** for `numerical/`. It answers one question per algorithm: *which mathematical
properties must a correct implementation satisfy, and how do we assert them?*

## Rationale

A numerical algorithm is not validated by "it compiles and doesn't crash." Every family has a small
set of **characteristic invariants** — properties that hold for any correct implementation
regardless of parameters (a low-pass filter must attenuate above cutoff; an ODE integrator must
reproduce a known analytic solution to its order; a Kalman filter's covariance must stay
positive-definite). A unit test earns its place by pinning one such invariant against a **known
ground truth**, not by re-running the implementation and trusting its own output.

This file groups the library by **metric family** so a test author picks the right invariants fast:
FFT needs spectral/energy metrics, a PID needs transient-response metrics, a solver needs
residual/convergence metrics. Without this, tests drift toward shallow "golden output" snapshots that
pass while the math is wrong.

Canonical rules still apply ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [testing.instructions.md](.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md)):
`TEST_F` on `float`, one behaviour per test, no redundant cases, **no heap in tests**, assert with
`EXPECT_NEAR` + `math::Tolerance<float>()` against reference values.

## How the agent uses this

1. Identify the target algorithm's **family** (section below).
2. From that family's row, take the **applicable metric types** and author **one `TEST_F` per
   distinct property** — not per parameter permutation.
3. Prefer **analytic ground truth** (closed-form response, known transform pair, hand-solved system)
   over self-consistency. Fall back to a cross-method check (e.g. FFT vs direct DFT) only when no
   closed form exists.
4. Always include the cross-cutting metrics (accuracy, boundary, determinism/reset) plus the
   family-specific ones. Keep signal/data generation on the stack (`std::array`, bounded buffers).

## Metric types (the vocabulary)

| M6 | **Boundary / edge**           | zero, saturation, extreme magnitude, min sizes               | clamp limits; zero-in→zero-out; no NaN/Inf at extremes                  |
| M7 | **Invariants & conservation** | energy/Parseval, norm, probability mass, orthogonality       | Parseval residual; ‖q‖=1; Σsoftmax=1; energy drift bound                |

  a standard non-convex test function (e.g. Rosenbrock) within the iteration budget.
- **M5 monotonicity** — objective decreases each step for a suitable step size; diverges/oscillates
  for too-large steps (documented boundary).

- **Bayesian** — best-observed value improves over iterations and locates the optimum of a cheap
  known function within the budget.

### 8. Regularization — `regularization/`
`L1`, `L2`.

- **M1 closed form** — L2 shrinks a coefficient by `1/(1+λ)`; L1 soft-thresholds by `λ` (drives
  small coefficients to exactly zero).
- **M7 penalty value & gradient** — penalty equals `λ·‖w‖₁` / `λ·‖w‖₂²`; sub/gradient correct.

`DurandKerner`, `RungeKuttaIntegrators`, `DormandPrince45`, `OdeSystem`.

- **M1 residual** — linear solves: `‖A·x − b‖` below tolerance on a hand-solved system; Cholesky
  reconstructs `A = L·Lᵀ`; assert SPD precondition handling.
- **M4/M1 DARE** — solution `P` symmetric positive-definite and the Riccati residual ≈ 0; matches a
  known small-system solution.
- **LevinsonDurbin** — solution equals the direct Toeplitz solve; reflection coefficients `|k| < 1`.

  factored polynomial; converges within max iterations.
- **ODE integrators (M1/M5)** — reproduce analytic solutions (exponential decay, harmonic
  oscillator) to tolerance; **order of accuracy**: global error scales as `h^p` (assert the slope);
  exact for polynomials up to the method order; adaptive step (DormandPrince45) keeps local error
  within the requested tolerance.

- **M5 inverse kinematics round-trip** — `FK(IK(pose)) ≈ pose`; converges within iteration budget;
  handles reachable vs unreachable targets (M6).
- **M1 cross-method consistency** — `RecursiveNewtonEuler` and `EulerLagrange` produce the same joint
  torques for the same state; both match the analytic torque of a simple pendulum / 2-link arm.
- **M7 energy** — conservation in free (unforced) motion; passivity of the mass matrix (SPD).

### 11. Neural network — `neural_network/`
`activation/*`, `layer/Dense`, `losses/*`, `model/Model`.

  `leaky_relu` slope; output range bounds; monotonicity where expected.
- **M7 softmax** — outputs sum to 1 and are non-negative; shift-invariance.
- **M1 loss values & gradients** — MSE of identical vectors = 0; loss non-negative; analytic gradient
  matches finite-difference (M1 gradient check).
- **M1 dense layer** — `output = W·x + b`; back-prop gradient check.
- **Model (M6)** — forward pass is deterministic and equals the manual layer composition.

### 12. Math foundation — `math/`
`Matrix`, `ComplexNumber`, `Quaternion`, `Cordic`, `TrigonometricFunctions`, `HyperbolicFunctions`,
`AdvancedFunctions`, `Statistics`, `LinearTimeInvariant`, `Toeplitz`, `QNumber`.

- **M1 accuracy vs `std::`** — trig/hyperbolic/CORDIC absolute (and where relevant ULP) error across
  the input range, including range-reduction boundaries.
- **M7 identities** — `sin²+cos² = 1`; `cosh²−sinh² = 1`; quaternion `‖q‖` preserved under
  multiplication; rotation composition; `q·q⁻¹ = 1`.
- **M1 matrix algebra** — `A·A⁻¹ = I` residual; determinant / transpose / multiply vs known results;
  associativity.
- **M9 conditioning / quantization** — `QNumber` quantization-error bound and saturation behaviour;
  `Statistics` numerically stable mean/variance (Welford) vs the naive formula.
- **LTI** — step/impulse response and pole/zero placement vs analytic (M3/M4).

## Anti-patterns

- Golden-output snapshots with no independent reference ("the output is whatever it printed").
- One test per parameter value instead of one per property (violates *no redundant tests*).
- Asserting only "no NaN / no crash" without a numerical reference.
- Heap-allocated signal buffers in tests — use `std::array` / bounded buffers.
- Re-deriving the algorithm inside the test as the "reference" — the reference must be independent
  (closed form, hand computation, or a distinct method).
