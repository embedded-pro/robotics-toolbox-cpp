Analyze the following task for the **robotics-toolbox** project — a numerical algorithms library for DSP, control algorithms, filters, optimizers, and estimators targeting resource-constrained embedded systems. Gather relevant context from the codebase — identify affected modules, existing patterns, numeric types involved (`float`, `math::Q15`, `math::Q31`), and documentation requirements. Then provide a brief scope summary and use the handoff buttons to route to the appropriate specialist:

- **Plan Implementation**: For complex tasks needing detailed upfront design (new algorithms, architectural changes, multi-file modifications)
- **Execute Directly**: For straightforward changes with a clear path (bug fixes, small improvements)
- **Review Code**: For reviewing existing or recently changed code against project standards

Task to orchestrate:
